# Container Playpen

Thie repo contains no code or anything else of much use to anybody other than myself. It is only public
in order that I can more easily play with a toy [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) installation without
struggling with private container repository keys.

None of the Docker containers stored here have any practical use or value.
